 How to use:
- Press F5 to start up the application 
- The attract screen should show up and on that screen read the words on the screen!!!!! 

IF USING KEYS
- When in the game, press the "P" key to pause and unpause the game
- When in the game, press the "Esc" key to go back to the attract mode and restarts the game 
- When in the game, press the "O" key to pause and go one frame in real time. Continously pressing this key does this function continuously
- When in the game, hold down the "T" key to play in slow motion
 
- When in the game, press the "N" key to respawn if you died
- When in the game, hold down the "E" key to move forward at full speed
- When in the game, hold down the "S" key to turn left 
- when in the game, hold down the "F" key to turn right
- When in the game, hold down the Spacebar to shoot

IF USING XBOX CONTROLLER
- When in the game, press the Left Shoulder button to pause and unpause the game
- When in the game, press the "B" button to go back to the attract mode and restarts the game 
- When in the game, press the "Y" button to pause and go one frame in real time. Continuously pressing this button does this function continuously 
- When in the game, hold down the Left Trigger to play in slow motion

- When in the game, press the Start Button to respawn if you died
- When in the game, push up on the Left Stick to thrust forward. You can push all the way forward for full throttle or slighlty for slower speeds. 
- When in the game, use the Left Stick to turn left or right and thrust in that direction
- when in the game, hold down on the Right Trigger to shoot 

Additional & New Feautures:
- I incorporated a title in the attract mode called "StarShip Gold". Each letter lerps at its own speed through a wide variety of colors randomly selecting RGB while fading in and out
- The play butotn icon aslo lerps and constanlty randomizes its RGB colors 
- You can also see the thrusters of the player ship on the attract mode the same way you would thrust in the game but either pressing the "E" key or pushing up on the Left Stick of the 
controller

- In the game, when the player completes a wave, theres a text that pops up in the middle of the screen that tell the player that the next wave is incoming and it shows the time remaining
before the next wave starts

- There's a new enemy type in the game. The enemy is a enemy ship that is red and has green thruster. It shoots at the player when its within a certain range and stops within a certain
range so it never crashes into the player intentionally like the beetle does. It does always track the player location and is constantly moving towards the player. It also dodges some of 
the bullets that the player shoots at it, and continues to move after the player has died. 

Known Bugs & Build Issues 
- No known bugs or build issues 

Deep Learning: 

While working on this project, at first I did not have a idea of what I wanted to do until I started. That prompted me to do a crazy lerping this with the letters on the Attract Mode UI. 
From there I decided to put my programming skills to the test and develop a somewhat advance AI enemy that can do more that just find the player and shoot at the player. I asked quite a bit of questions regarding how the dodge mechanic works, as well as ask other that did enemy AI if they did a dodge mechanic and what their approach to it was. In terms of the necesseary 
things needed for this assignment, with the audio, I look at my code and seen where things where and placed audio there where the sound will play correclty. I had this undestanding from doing audio in my unity games. One thing to note is that instead of doing the whole code without testing, I should divide the code in chunks and test after each chunk so I can see what works and what doesn't work, and if the program works how I want or how it suppose to work first before going on to the next chunk. Doing it all at one time slos the process of completing the work because if it doesn't work and there's no bugs, then you have a harder time figuring out what the issue is and what to debug. In the future I plan on doing more research, asking more questions about things I don't know, and trying even though I may not know how to fully approach a task/problem. If you atleats try and run the code, you increase the possibility of getting something to happen so then you can go from there. After seeing the professor talking aloud about the code he write and how he would try things and see if it works, got me to this insight.
