My dog is Sam and Sam is everyone's friend.
My love for gaming has gotten stronger when playing with a friend.
My dog is not a good dog at all.
A good dog will always run back to me.
Me and Son and good buddies and Anishva is a great guy and we are bros from Guildhall.
Guildhall has taught me a lot of things over the past year or so.
Anishva is certified Indian that's American at heart.
Son loves to cook for us on his free time.
